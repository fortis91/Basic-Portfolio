        <!-- <h3>Senior Software Developer at Cboe Global Markets.</h3> -->
   
        <p style="text-align:justify;">I'm a Software Developer and Technoolgy Enthusiastic with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science from Norteastern Illinois University.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Over the past 18 years, I spend my days working at Cboe Global Markets in Chicago as a Java/Web Developer
            where I'm involved in complete system development life cycle and maintenance of Web and back-end applications.
            For web front-end developement my applications use a combination of Angular.js and DOJO and even older Apache Struts running on Jetty.
            I use a combination of Java Domains, PL/SQL and Hibernate to query and update Oracle databases. </p>
            Away from work I'm a like to read about technoloy and play with anything tech. My friends think since I work with computers that I should
            be able to fix their computers all the. Even though I like to play around with hardware, I often them them that I'm a software guy. I also like playing around with SBC, I have a few Raspberry Pi
            doing different tasks.
